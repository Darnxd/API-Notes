📚 API Security Fundamentals – B.Tech CSE Notes

🔐 1. What is API Security?
API (Application Programming Interface): A way for apps/services to communicate.

API Security: Techniques to prevent unauthorized access, abuse, or attacks on APIs.

⚠️ 2. Why is API Security Important?
APIs expose critical data and backend systems.

Common in mobile, web, IoT, and cloud apps.

APIs are increasingly the primary attack vector in modern breaches.

🧨 3. How Are APIs Attacked?
Broken Authentication: Fake users get access. 
    
Excessive Data Exposure: API returns too much sensitive data.
    
Rate Limiting Bypass: Attackers flood APIs with requests (DoS).

Mass Assignment: Unauthorized fields manipulated via JSON/XML.

Injection Attacks: Malicious code in API input.
