‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Why is API Security Important?

üß® 3. How Are APIs Attacked?
Broken Authentication: Fake users get access. 
    
Excessive Data Exposure: API returns too much sensitive data.
    
Rate Limiting Bypass: Attackers flood APIs with requests (DoS).

Mass Assignment: Unauthorized fields manipulated via JSON/XML.

Injection Attacks: Malicious code in API input.
